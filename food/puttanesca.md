I cut down on a number of the ingredients from the original

Marinara base:
=============
 - 4 medium cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped
 - 20 large fresh basil leaves, coarsely chopped
 - 1/2 teaspoon salt
 - 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
 - 1/4 cup cold water
 - 16 ounces canned crushed tomatoes

Puttanesca sauce:
================
 - 1/4 cup olive oil
 - 8 flat anchovy fillets, rinsed and drained
 - 3 medium cloves garlic, peeled and minced
 - 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley
 - 1-2 pinches crushed red pepper flakes
 - 1/4 cup capers, rinsed and drained
 - 24 pitted Kalamata olives
 
 - 16 ounces penne pasta (or substitute ziti or mostaccioli)
 - 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Preparation
===========

1. To prepare the marinara base: Combine the garlic and basil in a food processor or blender and chop finely. Add the salt, black pepper and water; process 30 seconds. Stir into the tomatoes and set aside.
2. To prepare the puttanesca sauce: Heat the olive oil in a large saute pan. Add the anchovies and cook, mashing with the back of a spoon, until disintegrated. Add the garlic, parsley and crushed red pepper flakes. Cook 1 minute. Add the capers and olives; cook 20 seconds.
3. Stir in the marinara base and simmer 5 minutes. Keep warm.
4. Cook the pasta in lots of boiling water according to package directions. Drain and put back into the hot pan.
5. Add the sauce and Parmesan. Stir well and transfer to a heated bowl for serving.

Notes
=====

 - I don't use a food processor, just mince all the stuff.
 - Pasta measure: going with fill to almost-full whatever bowl you are going to eat out of with dry pasta.
 - Refrigerate or freeze the rest of the sauce (not sure how the frozen sauce will be, but I guess I'll see.)
