This is for half the recipe since the whole recipe does not fit in my 6qt pot.

Ingredients
===========

  - 4 ounces cremini mushrooms
  - 1 cloves garlic
  - 3/4 teaspoons dried thyme
  - 3/4 teaspoons dried parsley
  - 1/2 small yellow onion
  - 1 small leek (split in half, trimmed of dark green part and stem)
  - 2 large stalks celery
  - 4 cups (1 quart) water
    
For the gumbo:
  - 1 cup dried black-eyed peas (soaked overnight)
  - 1/2 cup dried baby lima beans (soaked overnight)
  - 1 medium yellow onions
  - 3 garlic cloves, crushed
  - 2 large stalks celery
  - 1 medium green bell peppers
  - 1/2 cup sustainable red palm oil (or whatever oil)
  - 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
  - 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided, plus more as needed
  - 1 Scotch bonnet pepper (pierced and de-seeded) (used whatever pepper was in the garden)
  - 1 tablespoon BTB fake chicken broth
  - 1 tablespoon tomato paste
  - 1/2 pound okra (cut cross-wise and into 1/2 - 1/3 inch pieces)
  - 1 (about 14-ounce) package extra-firm tofu
  - 1/2 tablespoon filé powder
  - 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
  - 1 tablespoon fish sauce
  - 1 teaspoon smoked paprika 
  - Freshly ground black pepper
  - Creole seasoning, such as Wanda’s Creole All
  - Distilled white vinegar
  - Hot sauce
    Cooked white rice, for serving

Preparation
===========
Make the stock
 - Char the onion (cut side up), leek, celery in broiler for 15 minutes
 - Place mushrooms, garlic cloves, dried thyme, and dried parsley in a medium pot.
 - Add water and charred stuff
 - Simmer for 1 hour and strain.
 - let cool and refrigerate for up to 1 week or freeze for up to 2 months.

Make roux
 - On stove top. Heat oil and flour in a dutch oven over low heat until it turns that red color (about 15 minutes).
 - In oven. Heat oil and flour in a cast iron skillet in a 375F oven for 75-90 minutes, stirring every 25-30 minutes.

Make gumbo
  - Make beans with the mushroom stock in instant pot (high pressure 15 minutes, natural release).
  - Saute onions, celery, bell peppers in roux, then garlic, hot pepper, and tomato paste, then cooked beans with stock.
  - Add spices and okra and tofu.
  - Simmer for about 20 minutes or until thick

Notes
=====

So it has fish sauce -- just saying.
