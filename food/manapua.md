## Manapua - steamed 

### Dough-1
 - 1 teaspoon active dry yeast (Hope that is what is in a packet, since that is what I used)
 - ¾ cup warm water
Proof 
 
 - 2.5 cups all-purpose flour
 - 0.5 cup cornstarch
 - 5 tablespoons sugar
 - 1/4 cup canola or vegetable oil
Mix and knead with proofed yeast
Cover and rise 2 hours

 - 2 teaspoons baking powder
Knead into dough and cover and rest 15 minutes 

### Filling

I'm guessing at this. Will update later
 - 2 cups won bok cabbage, chopped (about 2 leaves)
 - 2 oz cremini minced
 - 1 soaked shiitake, minced
 - 1/2 package of dried tofu,minced (~5 oz)
 - 3T shoyu
 - 1t sesame oil
 - 3/4t asafoetida
 - 1t? lemon/lime juice
Stir fry
Thicken with mixture of 1T cornstarch + 1/4c water

### Make
 - Cut 12 squares of parchment/wax paper
 - Divide dough into 12 pieces (Might be a good idea to weigh them. I suck at dividing)
 - Roll out into flat circles (middle thinner than edges)
 - Fill and pinch the top (Pull up and pinch?)
 - Put parchment/wax paper on the bottom
 - Does not need a to rise before steaming.

### Steam
 - Use a wok or whatever. I used a wok on our electric flat top.
 - Boil 2 cups of water in a kettle to make things go faster.
 - Add water to wok and get it steaming on high
 - Add bao leaving ~1inch between them. (They get really big)
 - Steam 12 minutes

### Notes
 - boiled more water near the end of the first batch to refill the wok for the second.
 - Supposedly able to double-wrap and freeze once cool. Reheat in a wet paper towel 35 seconds in microwave. (Yet to try this).
 
 ### Dough-2
 * A heaping teaspoon of active dry yeast
* 1 cup milk, warmed to 100-110°F
* 3 cups all-purpose flour
* 6 tablespoons of sugar
* 1/4 cup vegetable oil

Turn the oven on to the lowest setting (mine is 170°F).

Dissolve the yeast in the warm milk.  If you don't have a thermometer, the milk should feel a little warmer than a fever.

Combine the flour and sugar, then add the milk mixture and oil.  Mix together until a dough forms and knead a few minutes until smooth.  Cover the bowl and place in the oven.  Turn off the heat and let the dough proof for an hour or until doubled.

Once the dough has doubled, remove from the oven and turn the oven on again to the lowest setting.  Punch the dough down and knead a few more times.  Divide into twelve equal pieces (I divide in half twice and then divide each quarter into thirds).  Shape and fill the dough at this point if desired.  Place each bun on a square of parchment paper.  Cover and place in the oven, turning off the oven again.  Let proof another 40-60 minutes.

Steam the buns for 13 minutes.  I use my stockpot with the pasta insert as one level and the steamer insert as a second level so I can steam 6 at a time.

If not eating immediately, freeze and reheat in the microwave before eating.
