Preparation
===========
1. saute chicken until it turns "that color" which is mostly cooked. Remove chicken.
2. Add broth with the soaked oysters and sliced shiitakes. Bring to a boil
3. Add wintermelon, straw mushrooms, bamboo shoot. Simmer about 15 minues, until wintermelon is tender
4. Add chicken. Simmer another 5 minutes.

Notes
=====
That cornstarch is not going to make a clear broth, but I'm too lazy to use another pot and it tastes fine to me. 
Adjust salt accordingly.
3 dried oysters might be a bit much. I just had leftover dried oysters from making jai. I took them out after the soup was done bc Ary didn't want it to get any more oyster-y.
