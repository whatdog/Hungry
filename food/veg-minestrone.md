Fast and easy

Ingredients
===========

 - 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
 - 1 medium onion, finely chopped
 - 2 medium carrots, finely chopped
 - 2 cloves garlic, minced
 - 4 cups bean water
 - 1 14.5-ounce can diced tomatoes organic and BPA free
 - 1 2-inch chunk parmesan rind optional
 - 1/2 teaspoon salt
 - 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
 - 1-2 cups cooked beans, such as cannellini, navy or garbanzos
 - 1-2 cups green vegetable, such as cut green beans, diced zucchini, chopped chard or spinach
 - 2 cups cooked small pasta, such as orzo or ditalini
 - finely grated parmesan cheese for serving optional

Preparation
===========
    Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook the onion, carrots and garlic, stirring for about 4 minutes until the onion turns translucent but the vegetables do not brown.

    Bring the bean water and tomatoes with their juice to a simmer. Add the parmesan rind, if using, salt and pepper and check for seasoning, adding additional salt to suit your taste. (You can prepare the soup in advance up to this point.) Simmer for about 15 minutes.

    Add your choice of green vegetable and simmer until cooked through but the vegetables still have some life and texture, about 15 minutes.

    To serve, portion the pasta into serving bowls and ladle the hot soup over the pasta. Top with a portion of parmesan cheese, if using.

Notes
=====

I like this because it is just 1-2 cups of whatever veggie.
