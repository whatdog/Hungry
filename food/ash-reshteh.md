I think I've settled on this easy version

Ingredients
===========
4 cups cooked beans or 2 cans of beans (whatever kind: kidney, pinto, cannellini)   
1 can garbanzo beans with liquid   
1 cup dried lentils, rinsed   
6-8 cups beef or veggie broth   
1 bunch spinach, chopped (about 4 oz, or 4 packed cups)   
1 bunch parsley, chopped (about 1 oz)   
1 bunch cilantro, chopped (about 1 oz)   
1 bunch dill, chopped (about 1 oz) (I've sub'd 2-3Tblsp dried dill)   

Preparation
=====
1. Toss the beans and lentils into the broth, bring it to a boil and simmer for 20-25min (essentially cooking the lentils)
2. Toss in the chopped greens and let simmer another 10-15 minutes or however long you like the greens cooked down.

Topping
===
1/4c ghee or olive oil   
1 onion, sliced   
3 garlic cloves, sliced   
2 tsp mint   
1/2 tsp ground turmeric   
pinch of salt   

Fry them up for garnish.   
Add Yogurt or kashk if you can find it.   

Noodles
===
I use linguini broken in half. I've never really looked for reshteh in the store.   
I also don't add it to the soup, just cook it separately then toss it in the bowl(s) you're eating out of and add the soup.   

Notes
=====
* I had some cooked Christmas lima beans (2 cups) and about 4 cups of the liquid from cooking them. 
* Used water and veggie Better than Bouillon (1 tablespoon) to make up the other 2 cups.
* Used a can of garbanzo's w/liquid. 
* Cooked the pasta separately and just poured the soup over it in the bowl.
* Topping: Saute the onion, garlic, mint in niter kibbeh w/salt.
