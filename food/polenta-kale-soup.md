Quick and easy. This is the lazy version with less salt.

Ingredients
===========

* 1 leek, finely chopped. (I've used an onion instead)
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 3 medium cloves garlic, minced
* Pinch red pepper flakes (Used the crispy chili pepper oil with the woman on the label)
* 2 quarts Better Than Bouillon No Chicken Base (I use about 2 tablespoons)
* 1 cup polenta (coarse corn meal) --I've used medium ground w/no ill effect
1 quart packed roughly chopped kale leaves (stems removed)
1 heaping tablespoon miso paste (whatever miso is in the refrigerator)
4 scallions, thinly sliced
Toasted sesame oil, for serving

Preparation
===========
Throw onions and garlic into the broth. (I'm too lazy to saute the onions and garlic first.)
Whisk in polenta and bring to a boil then reduce to simmer (low) for 20 min.
Stir in kale - 5 min
Add miso
Serve w/drizzle of sesame oil and scallions

Notes
=====
Add tofu or canned garbanzos for more protein if you want.
