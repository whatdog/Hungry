This is a big recipe. I ended up using my brew kettle.

Ingredients
===========

 - 3 smoked ham hocks (sub 9 chopped slices (6oz) bacon w/fat. Sometimes I just use 1 (1.5 - 2lb) ham hock.)
 - 2 quarts chicken broth or water
 - 2 portuguese sausage (or sub a kielbasa for one of the sausages), sliced or cubed 1/2 inch
 - 2 garlic cloves, minced
 - 1 medium onion, chopped
 - 2 cans (15 ounce) kidney beans, liquid included
 - 2 large carrots, peeled diced 1/2 inch
 - 2 celery stalks, diced 1/2 inch
 - 1 can (16 ounce) crushed tomatoes
 - 1 can (16 ounce) tomato sauce
 - 1 cup elbow macaroni, uncooked
 - 1 teaspoon salt
 - 1 tablespoon chinese chili sauce (sambal olek)
 - 1⁄2 teaspoon pepper
 - 1⁄2 medium head of cabbage, core removed, cubed 1 inch [I used the whole thing]
 - 2 large potatoes, peeled cubed 3/4 inch


Preparation
===========
Simmer ham hocks in 2 quarts of broth until tender (or Instant pot w/about 4c water for about 50-60min, NR). Reserve the broth and cool the ham hocks, removing the meat once cooled.

Clean and reheat the pot used to make the broth. Add in the Portuguese sausage and lightly fry. Add in the garlic and onions and cook for 2 minutes. Add back the broth and bring to a simmer. (Sometimes I just roast the sausage in a 350F oven for about 20 min, then cut them up).

Add in the rest of the ingredients except the cabbage and potatoes and cook until the ingredients are tender and the flavor is developed.

Add the cabbage and potatoes and simmer until tender.

Adjust consistency and seasoning with additional chicken stock, salt, pepper, and Sambal.

The soup will continue to thicken over time as the pasta and potatoes absorb liquid. Keep adjusting consistency as needed. If you like more ham, you can add diced ham to the recipe. Also, this soup tastes better the next day!

(Substitute two-to-four ounces per hock with: chopped bacon, guanciale)
