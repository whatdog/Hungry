Love this juice. Slightly salty, tart and refreshing. Doesn't keep very long in the refrigerator.

Ingredients
===========

    3 Granny Smith apples, scrubbed, coarsely chopped
    ½ bunch parsley, coarsely chopped (leaves and stems)
    5 celery stalks with leaves attached, coarsely chopped, plus more for serving
    ¼ cup apple cider vinegar
    Pinch of kosher salt
    ¼ tsp. freshly ground black pepper, plus more for serving
    12 oz. gin (optional)

Preparation
===========
Purée apples, parsley, 5 celery stalks, and 3 cups water in batches in a blender. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a pitcher, gently pressing with a spoon to extract as much liquid as possible (alternatively, run apples, parsley, and celery through a juicer and mix with 3 cups water). Stir in vinegar, salt, and ¼ tsp. pepper and add more celery stalks.

To serve, pour 4 oz. juice and 1 oz. gin, if using, into an ice-filled glass and sprinkle with pepper.

Notes
=====
 - I use a hop bag (nutmilk bag?) to strain the puree.
 - Fits into 2 large soup takeout containers.
 - I just mix gin:juice 1:3.
