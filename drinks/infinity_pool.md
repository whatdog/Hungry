Tried this for Moe's birthday at Quileute Resort. Tasty.

Ingredients
===========

* 1 1/3 cups chilled mezcal
* 1 1/3 cups chilled Lillet blanc
* 2/3 cup chilled 1:1 simple syrup(recipe follows)
* 2 1/4 teaspoons celery bitters
* 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons water
* 1 1/3 cups fresh celery juice (from about 12 celery stalks)
* 1 cup fresh lemon juice

Preparation
===========

Up to 1 day before serving, make the batch. Pour chilled mezcal, chilled Lillet blanc, chilled simple syrup, celery bitters, and water into a 2-quart pitcher and stir to mix. Seal well, covering with plastic wrap if needed, and refrigerate.
Up to 2 hours before serving, prepare celery and lemon juices and stir into pitcher mix. Reseal and return to refrigerator if not serving immediately.

To serve, stir mixture well. Place a large ice cube in each rocks glass, then pour in cocktail and garnish with a small pinch of smoked salt and a lemon wheel, if desired.

Notes
=====

1:1 simple syrup
Makes about 1 cup plus 3 tablespoons

* 3/4 cup sugar
* 3/4 cup very hot water

Combine sugar and hot water in a resealable container, such as a mason jar, and stir to dissolve slightly. As soon as itâ€™s cool enough to handle, seal container and shake until sugar is completely dissolved. Let cool completely and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks.
