I like the peppery and somewhat bitter taste of this.

Ingredients
===========
 * 2 cups burdock root
 * 2 cups ginger
 * 1 cup orange peels
 * 1 cup cinnamon chips
 * 1/3 cup peppercorns
 * 5.5 tablespoons cardamom
 * 3 tablespoons cloves

1/2c of the above mixture + 

 * 15 grams of reishi
 * 20 grams of astragalus
 * 20 grams of codonopsis

Preparation
===========
put all the herbs above in a pot with about 60 ounces (7.5 cups) of water and cover. 
Simmer for an hour
Strain

Notes
=====
I'm not too picky about adding the right amount of reishi, astragalus, codonopsis. I just toss a few stalks of each in.
I make up a batch and put it in the refrigerator so lazy me can nuke it a bit and add hot water to heat it the rest of the way up.

I came across this recipe a while back when it was still http://www.methowvalleyherbs.com/2012/12/creating-herbal-medicine-chest-for-cold.html
